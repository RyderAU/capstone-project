Virtual Machine Credentials:

Username: lubuntu
Password: lubuntu
(to become root, use sudo su)

Steps to Setup:

1. Download VM (https://rebrand.ly/o1fy80n). This will be a zip. Extract the file. You shoud see
a OVF file called 'lubuntu_20.04.1_VM_LinuxVMImages'. We will need this file to open this file with the VM Player
so make sure you place the file in an accessible location.

2. Download the VM Player 
  - WINDOWS USERS - VMware Workstation 16 Player (https://rebrand.ly/0fhuhzh)
  - MAC USERS - VMWare Fusion (https://rebrand.ly/e0jl753 ) 

3. Import/Open the OVF file into the VM Player
  - WINDOWS USERS - Click 'Open a Virtual Machine'
  - MAC USERS - 'Choose File...'

4. Launch the VM. Be patient the boot process takes some time

5. Once you see a login interface, enter the 'Virtual Machine Credentials' (top of this document)

6. Search QTerminal 

7. Type 'sudo su' in terminal

8. Type 'sudo snap install --classic code' in terminal. This will install VSCode. Be patient this
will take time. You will get a successfully installed message in the terminal.

9. Exit 'sudo su' using Cntrl + D.

10. Then let us generate a git key. Type 'ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C z5555555@ad.unsw.edu.au"' in the terminal.
Replace with your email

11. Find your key using '/home/lubuntu/.ssh/id_ed22519.pub'. Copy and add to your GitHub 
(https://github.com/settings/keys)

 
12. Clone the repository using the command 
'git clone git@github.com:unsw-cse-comp3900-9900-21T3/capstone-project-3900-w18b-sudo_sandeep_reply.git'


13. You are ready to roll! Python 3.8.5 is already installed. But you will need to install pip. Use 'sudo su'
then run 'sudo apt install python3-pip'. It takes some time to install so please be patient.
