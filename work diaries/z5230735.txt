Week 1

Group created on course website. Group name decided and members added to Jira project. Drafted problem statement for Custom/Own Project Request Form (which can be transferred to the project proposal if our request is successful). Created epic and user stories as a group. I personally developed user stories for the functionality to chat and send messages, and the ability to search for messages in a group chat. I also created the project proposal document which I will continue to update with the other group members following the results of the Custom/Own Project Request Form.

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry

No previous work diary entry. Plans for the period included: form and name group, submit Custom/Own Project Request Form and develop user stories. Our group was formed in the T2 break where we held a few meetings to discuss possible custom project ideas and stack (although nothing was finalised).

- what was finished

Group admin (i.e. group creation and naming) finished. Custom/Own Project Request Form finalised and submitted to tutor for processing. User stories completed (although may be subject to change before project proposal submission)

- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)

Developing objectives for our custom project proved difficult at times, since we had to consider the overall complexity in comparison to the given projects. Response from course staff will give us a better understanding.

- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

N/A

- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Our next steps are heavily dependant on the results from the Custom/Own Project Request Form but in general they would be: draft background section of project proposal, create acceptance criteria for user stories, and draft storyboards and sprint start/end dates.


Week 2

Received email from mentor that our Custom/Own Project Request Form was not able to be accepted in its current state, as it was too similar to a project from 21T1. Discussed ways to differentiate project objectives in tutorial and finalised an amended form which was accepted. Met with group on Sunday to discuss project proposal, edit user stories (as  they were created based on old project spec) and draft storyboards. I created new user stories for the platform's timetable functionality, drafted the background section of the project proposal (based on the Custom/Own Project Request Form) and drafted user interface and storyboard for login and sign up page. I also created the GitHub Classroom team for our group.

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry

Our plans for this week were dependant on the results from the Custom/Own Project Request Form. In general, they were: draft background section of project proposal, create acceptance criteria for user stories, and draft storyboards and sprint start/end dates.

- what was finished

Storyboards and background section of project proposal were successfully drafted. Existing user stories were also edited to suit new specification. 

- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)

The main non-technical obstacle was the rejection of our initial project request. This was overcome by discussing our options with our mentor and editing our functionalities to differentiate ourselves from other projects.

- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

Acceptance criteria for user stories and sprint start/end dates were not finalised. With appropriate adjustments to our workload for week 3, this shouldn't affect the rest of the project or the project's success. We simply have more work to do next week.

- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Finalise project proposal and all tasks it encompasses (i.e background section, user stories and sprints, and technical depth, scale, and report formatting).


Week 3

Myself and z5208669 reworked the UI of our current storyboard design and presented it to the rest of the team. After approval of the new interface, our storyboard was updated to reflect the changes. I developed acceptance criteria for the user stories for group chat functionality. I also wrote the background section of the project proposal document.

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry

Finalise project proposal and all tasks it encompasses (i.e background section, user stories and sprints, and technical depth, scale, and report formatting).

- what was finished

Project proposal finalised and user stories for first sprint delegated.

- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)

Some user stories proved difficult to come up with and provide acceptance criteria for. Overcame this by thinking more of the user's path through the system.

- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

N/A

- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Commence and work on first sprint.


Week 4

Commenced first sprint. I developed functionality to display the student's courses on the main dashboard and established routing methods for the various menu options, using React and React Router respectively.

- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry

Commence and work on first sprint.

- what was finished

I successfully set up the dashboard page (without regards to styling).

- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was tried and did not work)

I was initially confused with how to nest routes within react, but I was able to overcome this through revision of react router.

- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered

N/A
